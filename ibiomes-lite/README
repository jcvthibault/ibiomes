OVERVIEW
=================================================================

iBIOMES Lite helps researchers keep track of their MD or QM experiments through 
a simple web interface. This can be accessed by the owner of the data locally or 
via the web if iBIOMES Lite is deployed in an environment that allows public HTML 
access (e.g. public_html folder at CHPC).

When a user publishes an experiment using the 'ibiomes-lite publish -i' command, 
the experiment directory is parsed recursively by the program to automatically 
generate metadata for the experiment and the file collection. The list of metadata 
is stored at the root of the experiment directory in a .ibiomes.xml file. This 
file is copied to the iBIOMES Lite web directory ($IBIOMES_LITE_WEBDIR) then 
transformed into HTML through different XSLs.

Local access:
In your browser enter 'file://$IBIOMES_LITE_WEBDIR/index.html'
Where $IBIOMES_LITE_WEBDIR is the absolute path to the iBIOMES Lite web directory.

INSTALLATION
=================================================================

System requirements:
- Java 1.7+
- Optional: Web server / public HTML folder

Steps:
1. Get a copy of the ibiomes source code
2. Compile ibiomes project using 'mvn install -DskipTests' for the root folder ibiomes/ (you can also run this from ibiomes/ibiomes-lite 
   if you only need this component)
2. Set $IBIOMES_HOME to point to the root of the project folder
3. Add $IBIOMES_HOME/ibiomes-lite/scripts to your $PATH
4. Copy the lite-web folder to your web directory (e.g. ~/public_html)
5. Set $IBIOMES_LITE_WEBDIR to point the new lite-web folder

=================================================================
USAGE
=================================================================

Use the 'publish' command to generate web content for an experiment:

ibiomes-lite-publish -i experiment-dir [-s software] [-x xml-descriptor] [-f]
ibiomes-lite-publish -u

[-u] Reload published experiments.
[-i experiment-dir] Path to the root of the experiment directory
[-s software] Name of the software package used to run the simulation/calculations (e.g. amber, nwchem)
[-x xml-descriptor] Path to the XML descriptor that specifies metadata generation rules
[-f] Force update of the experiment descriptor if this experiment is already published in iBIOMES Lite

Use the 'clean' command to remove content (XML and HTML) from iBIOMES Lite website. 
XML descriptors at the experiment directory level are conserved, and can be published again. 
If the -i option is not specified then all experiments are removed.

ibiomes-lite-clean
ibiomes-lite-clean -i experiment-dir

[-i experiment-dir] Path to the experiment to remove from iBIOMES Lite


=================================================================
EXAMPLES
=================================================================

The $IBIOMES_LITE_WEBDIR/examples/experiments/ directory contains examples of file collections that can 
be published into iBIOMES. To publish an experiment type:

ibiomes-lite-publish -i $IBIOMES_LITE_WEBDIR/examples/experiments/[experimnent_name] -s [software]

For example:
ibiomes-lite-publish -i $IBIOMES_HOME/examples/amber1 -s amber
ibiomes-lite-publish -i $IBIOMES_HOME/examples/nwchem1 -s nwchem
ibiomes-lite-publish -i $IBIOMES_HOME/examples/gaussian1 -s gaussian


The $IBIOMES_LITE_WEBDIR/examples/rules/ directory contains examples of descriptor files for metadata 
generation rules. You can use these descriptors when publishing data into iBIOMES Lite.
For example:
ibiomes-lite-publish -i $IBIOMES_HOME/examples/amber1 -s amber -x $IBIOMES_HOME/templates/desc_amber.xml
